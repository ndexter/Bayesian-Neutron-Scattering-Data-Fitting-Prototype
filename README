This prototype was designed to be run on TeraGrid resources on the Neutron Science Portal.
Additional hooks were developed to create a UI in Rappture, but those are not provided 
with this repo. The program accepts parameterizations for Gaussians, Lorentzians, 
polynomials of arbitrary degree, and continuously varying background.
